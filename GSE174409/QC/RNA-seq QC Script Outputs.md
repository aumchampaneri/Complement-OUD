# RNA-seq QC Script Output Analysis

The output shows the successful execution of your bulk RNA-seq quality control script. Here's a breakdown of each section:

## Package Loading
The script loaded several R packages (dplyr, limma, gridExtra) with standard messages about function masking, which is normal behavior in R.

## Data Dimensions
- Your expression matrix contains **60,676 genes** (rows) and **80 samples** (columns)
- The preview shows raw count data for the first few genes across the first 5 samples

## Metadata Overview
The metadata contains 20 columns with comprehensive clinical information:
- Basic sample information (sample_id, region, diagnosis)
- Demographic data (sex, age, race)
- Technical variables (PMI, pH, RIN values)
- Clinical details (blood toxicology, medications, manner of death)

The preview shows samples are from the NAC (nucleus accumbens) brain region with OUD diagnosis, and includes details like:
- Post-mortem intervals (10-24 hours)
- RIN values (7.1-8.8, indicating good RNA quality)
- Toxicology findings showing opioids and other medications

## Processing Steps
- **"Setting rownames from expression data frame..."** - Confirms the fix for the missing rownames was applied
- Each **"null device 1"** represents a plot being saved to the QC directory
- **"Genes before filtering: 60,676 / Genes after filtering: 23,309"** - The filtering step removed ~62% of genes with low expression

## Results
The script successfully completed all QC steps and saved the results to the QC directory, which contains:
1. Plots showing expression distributions
2. Sample correlation heatmaps
3. PCA/MDS plots showing sample clustering patterns
4. Normalized and filtered expression data ready for differential expression analysis

The filtered dataset (23,309 genes) represents reliably expressed genes appropriate for downstream analysis.
