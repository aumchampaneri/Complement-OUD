!Series_summary	"Molecular and behavioral responses to opioids are thought to be primarily mediated by neurons, although there is accumulating evidence that other cell types play a prominent role in drug addiction. To investigate cell-type-specific opioid responses, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the nucleus accumbens of mice following acute morphine treatment. Â Differential expression analysis uncovered unique morphine-dependent transcriptional responses by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Further analysis using RNAseq of FACS-purified oligodendrocytes revealed a large cohort of morphine-regulated genes. Importantly, the affected genes are enriched for roles in cellular pathways intimately linked to oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, including the unfolded protein response. Altogether, our data illuminate the morphine-dependent transcriptional response by oligodendrocytes and offer mechanistic insights into myelination defects associated with opioid abuse."
!Series_overall_design	"For single-cell experiments, we perfoed Drop-seq on 4 biological replicates each of the nucleus accumbens from saline- or morphine-treated mice. For bulk RNAseq experiments, we performed FACS to purify oligodendrocytes from the entire brains of 6 mice (3 mock, 3 morphine), then isolated RNA and subjected to RNA sequencing."

The second read (75 bp) was then trimmed at the 5â² end to remove any TSO adaptor sequence and at the 3â² end to remove poly(A) tails of length 6 or greater, then aligned to the mouse (mm10) genome using STAR v2.4.2a with default settings. Uniquely mapped reads were grouped by cell barcode. A list of UMIs (unique molecular identifiers) in each gene, within each cell, was assembled, and UMIs within ED = 1 were merged together. The total number of unique UMI sequences was counted, and this number was reported as the number of transcripts of that gene for a given cell (see summary files)."
