CROSS-DATASET META-ANALYSIS REPORT
Complement System in Opioid Use Disorder (Mus musculus)
Analysis Date: June 01, 2025 
========================================================================

DATASETS ANALYZED:
1. GSE151807 - Fentanyl vs Control (Nucleus Accumbens)
2. GSE66351 - Heroin vs Control (Striatum)
3. GSE239387 - Morphine vs Control (Nucleus Accumbens)

COMPLEMENT GENE ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
GSE239387: 18/133 complement genes significantly changed (13.5%)

KEY FINDINGS:
- All three major opioids (fentanyl, heroin, morphine) affect complement gene expression
- Effects are observed in addiction-relevant brain regions (NAc, striatum)
- Consistent patterns suggest complement system involvement in OUD pathophysiology

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Complement system may be a common pathway affected by opioid addiction
- Potential therapeutic target for treating opioid use disorder
- Immune dysfunction may contribute to addiction vulnerability

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
- Validate findings in human postmortem brain tissue
- Investigate complement protein levels and activity
- Test complement-targeting therapeutics in addiction models
- Examine temporal dynamics of complement changes during addiction
