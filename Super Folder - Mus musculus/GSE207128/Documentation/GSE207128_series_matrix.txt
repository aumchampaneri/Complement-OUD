!Series_summary	"The development of substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex process involving multiple neurocircuitries and brain regions. The amygdala is a region that mediates the withdrawal effect as well as anxiety and depression-like behaviors. However, the transcriptional changes in each cell type during SUD is largely unknown. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and classified all cell types in the mouse amygdala under opioid dependence and withdrawal states. Our data revealed distinct changes in key biological processes, such as immune response, inflammation, synaptic transmission, and mitochondrial respiration in different cell populations. Dramatic differences were unraveled in the transcriptional profiles between dependence and withdrawal states. This report is the first single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from the amygdala under opioid dependence and withdrawal conditions, providing unique insights in understanding brain alterations during SUD, especially at the molecular and cellular levels."

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1	"Three batches of experiments were conducted, and each batch included one Naive, Dep and With group. Thus, nine independent biological samples were processed. Amygdala dissection and tissue dissociation were performed at the same time period (10am–12pm) for all the samples to limit circadian variation. The widely used Papain Dissociation System was modified based on other published protocols so that single cell solutions with high cell viability (~90%) could be acquired within 2 hours. Briefly, after mice were sacrificed brains were immediately dissected and transferred into ice-cold HBSS. The amygdalae were dissected from 4~5 mice according to the previous protocol and were pooled together. The tissues were cut into small pieces and incubated in 2ml pre-warmed papain solution (EBSS containing approximately 20 units/ml papain and 0.005% DNase) at 30°C for 45 min with gentle constant agitation. After the incubation, all the following procedures were performed on ice. The mixture was triturated gently with a fire polished 2ml Pasteur glass pipette and the supernatant were transferred carefully to a fresh tube. 2ml of EBSS containing the albumin ovomucoid inhibitor was added to the remaining tissues, which was triturated gently with another fire polished 2ml Pasteur glass pipette and the supernatant was transferred. This step was repeated one more time. The resulted 6ml supernatant containing single cells were pooled together and the cell clusters/tissue debris were removed by serial filtration through prewetted 70μm and 40μm cell strainers. The single cell suspension was centrifuged at 220g for 7 min at 4°C. The cells were then washed in 10ml PBS containing 0.04% BSA twice, after which the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.04% BSA. 10μl aliquots were stained with Trypan Blue and cell numbers were counted three times for each sample. During the whole procedure, 5% (w/v) trehalose was added in the buffers to ensure higher cell viability."
