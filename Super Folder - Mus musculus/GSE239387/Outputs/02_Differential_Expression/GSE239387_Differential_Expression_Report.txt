KEY BIOLOGICAL FINDINGS:
-------------------------
1. MORPHINE SUPPRESSES COMPLEMENT SYSTEM:
   - 78% of significantly changed complement genes are DOWNREGULATED
   - Classical pathway most affected (50% of genes significantly changed)
   - Associated complement genes show widespread downregulation

2. IMMUNE SUPPRESSION IMPLICATIONS:
   - Reduced complement activity may impair pathogen clearance
   - Decreased inflammatory response in nucleus accumbens
   - Potential vulnerability to infections with chronic opioid use

3. NEUROINFLAMMATION MODULATION:
   - Complement suppression may alter microglial activation
   - Changes in synaptic pruning and plasticity mechanisms
   - Potential neuroprotective effects vs. impaired neural development

STUDY LIMITATIONS:
-------------------
- Single brain region (nucleus accumbens) analyzed
- Acute morphine treatment (timepoint not specified in this analysis)
- Small sample size (n=4 per group)
- Need validation in chronic opioid exposure models

FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:
----------------------------
- Validate complement gene changes at protein level
- Examine other brain regions involved in addiction
- Time-course studies of complement system changes
- Functional assays of complement pathway activity
- Therapeutic targeting of complement system in OUD

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
Analysis method: limma (linear models for microarray data)
Expression data: Log2-transformed FPKM values
Statistical correction: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR
Significance threshold: p < 0.05 for individual genes
Effect size threshold: |log2FC| > 0.5 for visualization
