📁 ANALYSIS DATA saved to: Results/Neuroinflammatory_Analysis/

SCIENTIFIC APPROACH:
✓ Independent pathway enrichment per dataset (no cross-technology integration)
✓ Technology-aware normalization and analysis methods
✓ Cross-dataset pattern discovery (directional consistency only)
✓ Cell-type considerations for snRNA-seq data

DATASETS ANALYZED:
- GSE174409: Bulk RNA-seq (DLPFC vs NAc)
- GSE225158: snRNA-seq pseudobulk (Caudate vs Putamen)

ANALYSIS COMPONENTS:
1. Comprehensive gene set collections (Hallmark, GO, KEGG, Reactome, Literature)
2. Independent pathway enrichment per dataset
3. decoupleR TF and pathway activity inference
4. Cross-dataset pattern concordance analysis
5. Organized visualization suite

KEY FINDINGS:
- Gene sets analyzed: 57
- Datasets with enrichment results: 2
- Datasets with decoupleR results: 2

INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES:
- Results represent independent validation across brain regions and technologies
- Pattern concordance suggests robust neuroinflammatory signatures
- Technology-specific findings require separate interpretation
- Clinical validation needed for translational applications
