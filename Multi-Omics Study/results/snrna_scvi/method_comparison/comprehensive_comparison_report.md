## Recommendations

### For Publication
1. **Primary Analysis**: Use LEMUR for main findings (captures biological nuance)
2. **Validation**: Report DESeq2 concordance for top genes
3. **Method Comparison**: Include as supplementary analysis showing methodological robustness

### For Further Analysis
1. **Focus on Intersection Genes**: High confidence findings
2. **Investigate Method-Specific Genes**: May represent unique biological insights
3. **Regional Analysis**: Caudate vs Putamen show distinct patterns

### Quality Metrics
- **High Confidence Genes**: Found significant by both methods
- **LEMUR-Specific**: May represent latent biological processes
- **DESeq2-Specific**: May represent population-level effects
